Here's how you can structure a Rust library project:\n\n1. Create a new library project:\n   ```\n   cargo new my_library --lib\n   ```\n\n2. This will create a project structure like this:\n   ```\n   my_library/\n   ├── Cargo.toml\n   └── src/\n       └── lib.rs\n   ```\n\n3. The `lib.rs` file is the root of your library crate. You can define your public API here.\n\n4. Example `lib.rs`:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {\n       a + b\n   }\n\n   #[cfg(test)]\n   mod tests {\n       use super::*;\n\n       #[test]\n       fn it_works() {\n           assert_eq!(add(2, 2), 4);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. You can add more modules in separate files:\n   ```\n   my_library/\n   ├── Cargo.toml\n   └── src/\n       ├── lib.rs\n       └── math.rs\n   ```\n\n6. In `math.rs`:\n   ```rust\n   pub fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {\n       a * b\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. In `lib.rs`, you can include the module:\n   ```rust\n   pub mod math;\n\n   pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {\n       a + b\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. To use your library in another project, add it as a dependency in the other project's `Cargo.toml`:\n   ```toml\n   [dependencies]\n   my_library = { path = \"../path/to/my_library\" }\n   ```\n\nRemember, without a `main.rs`, your project won't produce an executable. It's designed to be used as a dependency in other projects or to be published on crates.io.\n\nIf you need to create examples or tests that run as executables, you can add them in the `examples/` and `tests/` directories respectively.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":36}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":30},"start":37,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":37}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":1679,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":38}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Rust Library Project Structure Without mainrs","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
